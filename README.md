# non-linear
Non-linear flight dynamics model of PC-9M for MatLab / GNU Octave

There are two directories: PC-9Mq for crunching digits; trajectory for visualising results. Results from PC-9Mq directory are exported to trajectory directly.

Control sequence might be changed in \PC-9Mq\private\controls.m
